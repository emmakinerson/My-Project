	abstract = {Bacteria emit a large number of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the environment. VOCs are species-specific and their emission depends on environmental conditions, such as growth medium, pH, temperature, incubation time and interaction with other microorganisms. These VOCs can enhance plant growth, suppress pathogens and act as signaling molecules during plant–microorganism interactions. Some bacterial VOCs have been reported to show strong antimicrobial, nematicidal, pesticidal, plant defense, induced tolerance and plant-growth-promoting activities under controlled conditions. Commonly produced antifungal VOCs include dimethyl trisulfide, dimethyl disulfide, benzothiazole, nonane, decanone and 1-butanol. Species of Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Enterobacter and Burkholderia produce plant growth promoting VOCs, such as acetoin and 2,3-butenediol. These VOCs affect expression of genes involved in defense and development in plant species (i.e., Arabidopsis, tobacco, tomato, potato, millet and maize). VOCs are also implicated in altering pathogenesis-related genes, inducing systemic resistance, modulating plant metabolic pathways and acquiring nutrients. However, detailed mechanisms of action of VOCs need to be further explored. This review summarizes the bioactive VOCs produced by diverse bacterial species as an alternative to agrochemicals, their mechanism of action and challenges for employment of bacterial VOCs for sustainable agricultural practices. Future studies on technological improvements for bacterial VOCs application under greenhouse and open field conditions are warranted.},

However, the influence of VOCs on growth and root architecture in soybean remains unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that VOCs would enhance the growth of soybean and change its root architecture. Thus, experiments under growth chamber were carried out to investigate the effect of VOCs released by B. subtilis AP-3 on growth and root architecture of soybean (control and plants exposed to VOCs) and eight replicates. Plant growth and root architecture parameters in soybean were measured 20 days after soybean emergence. Soybean exposed to microbial VOCs displayed significant increase in plant biomass (88\% and 18\% for shoot and roots, respectively) than the control. Microbial VOCs changed the root architecture of soybean that exhibited roots with higher length, diameter, surface area, and volume. The principal component analysis differentiated plants exposed to VOCs from those plants without exposure. The findings from this study are important since the modulation of root architecture can improve the absorption of water and nutrients from the soil.},

However, testing interactive effects typically requires large, multi-factorial experiments and thus remains challenging in many systems. Furthermore, most studies of plant microbiomes focus on terrestrial hosts and microbes. Aquatic habitats may confer unique properties to microbiomes. We grew different populations of duckweed (Lemna minor), a floating aquatic plant, in three microbial treatments (adding no, “home”, or “away” microbes) at two levels of zinc, a common water contaminant in urban areas, and measured both plant and microbial performance. Thus, we simultaneously manipulated plant source population, microbial community, and abiotic environment. We found strong effects of plant source, microbial treatment, and zinc on duckweed and microbial growth, with significant variation among duckweed genotypes and microbial communities. However, we found little evidence of interactive effects: zinc did not alter effects of host genotype or microbial community, and host genotype did not alter effects of microbial communities. Despite strong positive correlations between duckweed and microbe growth, zinc consistently decreased plant growth, but increased microbial growth. Furthermore, as in recent studies of terrestrial plants, microbial interactions altered a duckweed phenotype (frond aggregation). Our results suggest that duckweed source population, associated microbiome, and contaminant environment should all be considered for duckweed applications, such as phytoremediation. Lastly, we propose that duckweed microbes offer a robust experimental system for study of host–microbiota interactions under a range of environmental stresses.},

This Review highlights that despite the recent progress in microbial invasion research, we are only beginning to understand how alien microorganisms interact with native microorganisms, and the implications of those interactions.

	abstract = {Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a major currency in plant communication where they mediate above- and below-ground interactions between plants and the surrounding organisms (i.e., other plants, microorganisms, pollinators, seed dispersers, herbivores, and their natural enemies). Considering the multiple interactions mediated by VOCs and their impact on a plant’s reproductive success and survival, they can be a crucial weapon in plant-plant competition. However, this particular role of VOCs is underrepresented in the literature. Mechanisms by which volatiles can mediate plant competition can be direct or indirect. Direct mechanisms include establishing a neighbour’s identity and status to select adequate responses and affecting competitor’s seed germination or growth through VOC-mediated allelopathy. Indirect mechanisms can affect the plant's competitive ability by modifying interactions with other trophic levels, for instance, through associational resistance or chemical camouflage. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and can be seen as part of a continuum. In this review, we present evidence from the literature to illustrate these roles and indicate how they could influence competition in plant communities. We propose new research avenues to test if and how these mechanisms affect competitive outcomes and suggest that, in addition to morphological traits, future competition studies should also incorporate data on plant-volatile emissions and measure their effects on the surrounding plants and other trophic levels. This information would allow us to understand competition from a broader perspective by acknowledging the existence of multiple (possibly coexisting) competition strategies and the role of other trophic levels in shaping competitive outcomes.},

These automated tools facilitated the collection and analysis of time-resolved growth data, which revealed finer dynamics of plant-microbe interactions across environmental gradients.

Aquatic ecosystems seem at particular risk from invasive species because of threats to biodiversity and human needs for water resources. Here, we review some known aspects of aquatic invasive species (AIS) and explore several new questions. We describe impacts of AIS, factors limiting their dispersal, and the role that humans play in transporting AIS. We also review the characteristics of species that should be the greatest threat for future invasions, including those that pave the way for invasions by other species (“invasional meltdown”). Susceptible aquatic communities, such as reservoirs, may serve as stepping stones for invasions of new landscapes. Some microbes disperse long distance, infect new hosts and grow in the external aquatic medium, a process that has consequences for human health. We also discuss the interaction between species invasions and other human impacts (climate change, landscape conversion), as well as the possible connection of invasions with regime shifts in lakes. Since many invaders become permanent features of the environment, we discuss how humans live with invasive species, and conclude with questions for future research.},

A novel approach to improve animal and plant fitness is to artificially select upon microbiomes, thus engineering evolved microbiomes with specific effects on host fitness. We call this engineering approach host-mediated microbiome selection, because this method selects upon microbial communities indirectly through the host and leverages host traits that evolved to influence microbiomes. In essence, host phenotypes are used as probes to gauge and manipulate those microbiome functions that impact host fitness. To facilitate research on host-mediated microbiome engineering, we explain and compare the principal methods to impose artificial selection on microbiomes; discuss advantages and potential challenges of each method; offer a skeptical appraisal of each method in light of these potential challenges; and outline experimental strategies to optimize microbiome engineering. Finally, we develop a predictive framework for microbiome engineering that organizes research around principles of artificial selection, quantitative genetics, and microbial community-ecology.},

In communities, biotic interactions may either facilitate or constrain evolution depending on whether the interactions expand or contract the range of ecological opportunities. A fundamental challenge is to understand how the surrounding biotic community modifies evolutionary trajectories as species adapt to novel environmental conditions. Here we show that community context can dramatically alter evolutionary dynamics using a novel approach that ‘cages’ individual focal strains within complex communities. We find that evolution of focal bacterial strains depends on properties both of the focal strain and of the surrounding community. In particular, there is a stronger evolutionary response in low-diversity communities, and when the focal species have a larger genome and are initially poorly adapted. We see how community context affects resource usage and detect genetic changes involved in carbon metabolism and inter-specific interaction. The findings demonstrate that adaptation to new environmental conditions should be investigated in the context of interspecific interactions.},

To study the roles of phylogeny and environment on bacterial responses to sudden moisture increases, we determine bacterial population-specific growth rates by 18O-DNA quantitative stable isotope probing (18O-qSIP) in soils subjected to a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) combined with warming. We find that three growth strategies of bacterial taxa – rapid, intermediate and slow responders, defined by the timing of the peak growth rates – are phylogenetically conserved, even at the sub-phylum level. For example, members of class Bacilli and Sphingobacteriia are mainly rapid responders. Climate regimes, however, modify the growth strategies of over 90\% of species, partly confounding the initial phylogenetic pattern. The growth of rapid bacterial responders is more influenced by phylogeny, whereas the variance for slow responders is primarily explained by environmental conditions. Overall, these results highlight the role of phylogenetic and environmental constraints in understanding and predicting the growth strategies of soil microorganisms under global change scenarios.},

Furthermore, most studies of plant microbiomes focus on terrestrial hosts and microbes. Aquatic habitats may confer unique properties to microbiomes. We grew different populations of duckweed (Lemna minor), a floating aquatic plant, in three microbial treatments (adding no, "home", or "away" microbes) at two levels of zinc, a common water contaminant in urban areas, and measured both plant and microbial performance. Thus, we simultaneously manipulated plant source population, microbial community, and abiotic environment. We found strong effects of plant source, microbial treatment, and zinc on duckweed and microbial growth, with significant variation among duckweed genotypes and microbial communities. However, we found little evidence of interactive effects: zinc did not alter effects of host genotype or microbial community, and host genotype did not alter effects of microbial communities. Despite strong positive correlations between duckweed and microbe growth, zinc consistently decreased plant growth, but increased microbial growth. Furthermore, as in recent studies of terrestrial plants, microbial interactions altered a duckweed phenotype (frond aggregation). Our results suggest that duckweed source population, associated microbiome, and contaminant environment should all be considered for duckweed applications, such as phytoremediation. Lastly, we propose that duckweed microbes offer a robust experimental system for study of host-microbiota interactions under a range of environmental stresses.},

	abstract = {The application of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in the field has been hampered by a number of gaps in the knowledge of the mechanisms that improve plant growth, health, and production. These gaps include (i) the ability of PGPR to colonize the rhizosphere of plants and (ii) the ability of bacterial strains to thrive under different environmental conditions. In this review, different strategies of PGPR to colonize the rhizosphere of host plants are summarized and the advantages of having highly competitive strains are discussed. Some mechanisms exhibited by PGPR to colonize the rhizosphere include recognition of chemical signals and nutrients from root exudates, antioxidant activities, biofilm production, bacterial motility, as well as efficient evasion and suppression of the plant immune system. Moreover, many PGPR contain secretion systems and produce antimicrobial compounds, such as antibiotics, volatile organic compounds, and lytic enzymes that enable them to restrict the growth of potentially phytopathogenic microorganisms. Finally, the ability of PGPR to compete and successfully colonize the rhizosphere should be considered in the development and application of bioinoculants.},

	abstract = {The trait-based strategies of microorganisms appear to be phylogenetically conserved, but acclimation to climate change may complicate the scenario. To study the roles of phylogeny and environment on bacterial responses to sudden moisture increases, we determine bacterial population-specific growth rates by 18O-DNA quantitative stable isotope probing (18O-qSIP) in soils subjected to a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) combined with warming. We find that three growth strategies of bacterial taxa – rapid, intermediate and slow responders, defined by the timing of the peak growth rates – are phylogenetically conserved, even at the sub-phylum level. For example, members of class Bacilli and Sphingobacteriia are mainly rapid responders. Climate regimes, however, modify the growth strategies of over 90\% of species, partly confounding the initial phylogenetic pattern. The growth of rapid bacterial responders is more influenced by phylogeny, whereas the variance for slow responders is primarily explained by environmental conditions. Overall, these results highlight the role of phylogenetic and environmental constraints in understanding and predicting the growth strategies of soil microorganisms under global change scenarios.},

This study employed Illumina sequencing of ITS rDNA and 16S rRNA genes to identify the seasonal changes in soil microbial community, the predominant environmental factors driving microbial community composition, and the differences in soil microbial composition among different species of the genus Corylus. We found that the soil microbial community composition of species of Corylus changed significantly with the change in seasons. Corylus heterophylla and Corylus kweichowensis had more ectomycorrhiza in their soil compared to Corylus avellane. The main factor influencing fungal community composition in soil was the available potassium, while that of bacteria was the total phosphorus content. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that the ratio of positive interaction to negative interaction in soil of C. heterophylla and Ping'ou (C. heterophylla × C. avellane) was higher, while the negative interaction of soil community structure in C. avellane was greater. The bacterial community was more stable than the fungal community according to microbial diversity and co-occurrence network analyses. The findings of this research may facilitate improvements to the production and soil system management in hazel planting processes.},

In addition, duckweed can alleviate environmental pollutants and enhance sustainability by participating in bioremediation processes and wastewater treatment. Furthermore, insights into the genomic complexity of Lemnaceae species and the flourishing field of transgenic development highlight the opportunities for genetic manipulation and biotechnological innovations. Novel methods for the germplasm conservation of duckweed can be adopted to preserve genetic diversity for future research endeavors and breeding programs.

However, the OD alone is an unreliable metric and is only proportionately accurate to cell titers to about an OD of 0.1. The relationship between OD and cell titer depends on the configuration of the spectrophotometer, the length of the light path through the culture, the size of the bacterial cells, and the cell culture density. We demonstrate the importance of plate reader calibration to identify the exact relationship between OD and cells/mL. We use four bacterial genera and two sizes of micro-titer plates (96-well and 384-well) to show that the cell/ml per unit OD depends heavily on the bacterial cell size and plate size. We applied our calibration curve to real growth curve data and conclude the cells/mL–rather than OD–is a metric that can be used to directly compare results across experiments, labs, instruments, and species.},
